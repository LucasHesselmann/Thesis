MonteCarlo
==========
A simple Markov chain Monte Carlo algoritm to sample from a non-product target measure (multi modal Gaussian) in higher dimensions. In addition, the samples are analysed, e.g. the autocorrelation time is calculated.
Two versions are available, the random walk Metropolis algorithm and the Metropolis adjusted Langevin algorithm, abbreviated as RWM and MALA, respectively.
